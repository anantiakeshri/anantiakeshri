I work as a Cloud Security Analyst with a strong focus on application risk in cloud-native environments.

Over the past two years, my work has centered on securing how applications are designed, deployed, and accessed in multi-cloud environments. I focus on preventing application-level vulnerabilities caused by cloud misconfigurations—such as broken access control, exposed services, and insecure defaults—using strong architecture fundamentals, IAM controls, and DevSecOps practices.

I have hands-on experience with CNAPP platforms (Wiz, Aqua), CI/CD security automation, private endpoint architectures, AI governance enforcement, and compliance-driven controls. My approach emphasizes clarity, measurable security outcomes, and reducing real attack paths rather than closing alerts.

I am intentionally transitioning toward Application Security by deepening my work in secure design, API and identity security, and shift-left security practices—bridging cloud security with application security.
